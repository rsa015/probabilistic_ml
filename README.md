## Exercise 1:
* [x] Run a predefined mnistDemo using kNN algorithm
* [x] Modify the code randomly permute the features as in [shuffleDigitsDemo](https://github.com/probml/pmtk3/blob/dfe84aabf65d4e5133a62ac1f4722bf3834a3327/demos/shuffledDigitsDemo.m) and verify the effects of randomness on error rate.
